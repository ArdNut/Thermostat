# Thermostat
Source code for the thermostat from "Arduino: A Technical Reference".

Created for chapter 12 of "Arduino: A Technical Reference" by J. M. Hughes

Copyight 2015-2016 John M. Hughes

This is the least polished of the applications. It is also the most
complex. It still needs some rough edges smoothed down.

## Update 18 July 2016

I am continuing to work on the code and get it into its final form. The
last thing to work out is the profile handling. The state logic could
also use some attention.

## How to build the code

All you need to do is download the source as a zip file (there is a button
that will do that for you), and then unzip it into a directory called
"Thermostat" in your Arduino "sketchbook" directory.

Refer to Chapter 12 for instructions on how to test the code to verify that
it is working correctly with the hardware.
